# Image Filtering with Gaussian, Sobel and Median Filters
---
### Aim
This project applies and analyzes the effects of three key image processing filters: Gaussian, Sobel, and Median filters. The main objective is to demonstrate their functionalities in the following areas:

Noise Reduction
Edge Detection
Noise Removal
Filters

1. Gaussian Filter
The Gaussian filter is used to blur images, which helps in reducing noise. It works by applying a weighted average based on a Gaussian distribution, making it effective at smoothing out high-frequency noise.

2. Sobel Filter
The Sobel filter is used for edge detection. It calculates the gradient of the image intensity, helping identify areas with sharp intensity changes, which are typically edges in the image.

3. Median Filter
The Median filter is a non-linear filter useful for removing noise, especially salt-and-pepper noise. It replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighboring pixels, preserving edges better than some other types of filters.
